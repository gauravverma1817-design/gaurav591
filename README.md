The project is designed as a single-page web showcase that displays a collection of 

five different photographs.





Key Components:

Photographs: Each image has a unique title and a short, descriptive caption. The images include scenic views like a sunset road ("Golden Hour's Path") , a mountain valley ("The Lonely Guardian") , running horses ("Mustangs of the Mountain") , a puppy ("Golden Peekaboo") , and a city landmark ("Mumbai's Reflection").






HTML Structure: It demonstrates various fundamental HTML elements, including headings (<h1>, <h3>) , images (





<img>) , text formatting (bold 





<b>, italics <em>, underline <u>, and deleted <del>) , and links (



<a>).




Gallery Data: The file includes a table that compares the five artworks, listing a simulated Medium (e.g., "Oil on Canvas," "Paper Quilling") and a Year for each piece .



Lists: The project uses both an unordered list (<ul>) to describe "Techniques Used" (e.g., Digital Airbrushing, Layer Masking) and an 

ordered list (<ol>) to display "Gallery Rules".


In essence, it acts as a basic web portfolio to display image content and practice core HTML structuring skills.
